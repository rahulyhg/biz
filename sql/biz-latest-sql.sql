Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better.

For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution.

You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment.

You may also indicate to your customers that your product is of a special sort such as a solution that is eco-friendly or one that is faster, a solution that is easier and more convenient or one that is locally sourced. Of course all this must be in sync with what you have already committed in the Competitive Landscape Section.</p><p>Discuss your plans of distribution and pricing. What is the manner in which your customers will pay for your products and/or services? Will you expect them to pay at the store or in the field? Or do you want that they should pay at your website? The other options could be payment at the retailers or distribuiters or the resellers. The other point you may clarify is whether your customers are those that buy and use your products or will you sell your products to another company or companies that will include your solution along with theirs? Do you expect that your customers pay up for their purchase each time or will this be a continuous arrantement? There is obviously a fair amount to discuss in this space as can be seen. Additional topics may also be added to this section depending upon the size of your business and its complexity. In such a case it may be more convenient to simply discuss the major points in this space and only refer to all the other points for greater detail.

Discuss the kind of competition you have, who these ompetitors are and what are the kinds of solutions they have on offer similar to your solutions. Discuss also why in your opionion the customers might select their solution. </p><p>It is also possible that you may not have any competition in your field. This is fairly common with most of the newer startup innovative companies. The old stalwarts such as Ford did not have any competitors in their field back then. Their customers used whatever state transport was available. Pioneers such as Ford and Sony had to find a way to beat the existing alternatives. Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better. Your outlet might be very conveniently located or your customer service might be better. It is also feasible that your offer suits a certain class of customers.</p>', 'Current Alternatives', 1),

This is fairly common with most of the newer startup innovative companies. The old stalwarts such as Ford did not have any competitors in their field back then. Their customers used whatever state transport was available. Pioneers such as Ford and Sony had to find a way to beat the existing alternatives. Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better. Your outlet might be very conveniently located or your customer service might be better. It is also feasible that your offer suits a certain class of customers.</p>', 'Current Alternatives', 1),

It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution.

You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment.

You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment.

You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment.

Discuss also why in your opionion the customers might select their solution. </p><p>It is also possible that you may not have any competition in your field. This is fairly common with most of the newer startup innovative companies. The old stalwarts such as Ford did not have any competitors in their field back then. Their customers used whatever state transport was available. Pioneers such as Ford and Sony had to find a way to beat the existing alternatives. Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better. Your outlet might be very conveniently located or your customer service might be better. It is also feasible that your offer suits a certain class of customers.</p>', 'Current Alternatives', 1),

This is fairly common with most of the newer startup innovative companies. The old stalwarts such as Ford did not have any competitors in their field back then. Their customers used whatever state transport was available. Pioneers such as Ford and Sony had to find a way to beat the existing alternatives. Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better.

It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution.

This is fairly common with most of the newer startup innovative companies. The old stalwarts such as Ford did not have any competitors in their field back then. Their customers used whatever state transport was available. Pioneers such as Ford and Sony had to find a way to beat the existing alternatives. Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better. Your outlet might be very conveniently located or your customer service might be better. It is also feasible that your offer suits a certain class of customers.</p>', 'Current Alternatives', 1),

Discuss the kind of competition you have, who these ompetitors are and what are the kinds of solutions they have on offer similar to your solutions. Discuss also why in your opionion the customers might select their solution. </p><p>It is also possible that you may not have any competition in your field. This is fairly common with most of the newer startup innovative companies. The old stalwarts such as Ford did not have any competitors in their field back then. Their customers used whatever state transport was available. Pioneers such as Ford and Sony had to find a way to beat the existing alternatives. Therefore, in case you do not have any competitors just yet, it will still be necessary to debate on the method or methods used by your customers to solve their problem or problems. It is being wise to acknowledge the fact that competition is around the corner even if it is not available right now. You will always need to stay ahead of the race. For this reason you must identify the various advantages you have over all your competitors or alternatives that exist in the market. You will also need to assess whether your products and services enjoy a price advantage in your competitive environment. In case this is not true then you will have to find out why your customers will opt for your solution. The next choice might well be that your solution is better or faster or that your product lasts longer or tastes better. Your outlet might be very conveniently located or your customer service might be better. It is also feasible that your offer suits a certain class of customers.</p>', 'Current Alternatives', 1),
